# Unity-Web-Loader

Working with deploying WebGL in Unity

Unity Play is fairly worthless as a deployment with its weird screen size and inability to embed the actual app (it embeds an image that takes you back to Unity Play).

This allows for deployment anywhere, and just the CSS and JS in the index.html do it.
